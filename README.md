# PracticeIt-Grader
Grades PracticeIt student work

This is for people with "instructor" accounts on PracticeIt.  Unfortunately they no longer give
out accounts for college level classes, but they will for high schools.  I don't have anything
to do with running PracticeIt so I can't comment on why this is.

The input is a scraping of the instructor's results view.  This is intended to be run in 3 passes 
to build up the list of students, assigned problems, and finally the complete results.

 * Usage: 
 *      Called with just "practice-it.csv" (CSV file generated by PracticeIt)
 *              Writes list of students
 *              Remove any unwanted students and supply next time to filter list
 * 
 *  Called with raw results & "Student Usernames.txt"
 *      Writes filtered list of students and their problems
 *      Modify desired problems and save as "Assigned problems.txt"
 *  
 *  Called with raw results, student usernames, "Assigned problems.txt"
 *      Looks for header "SC" and all following problems will be assumed SC
 *        any other header is assumed to be "Ex"
 *      Writes filtered list of students with how they did on assigned problems
 * 
 *  Note Chapter 3G translated into 20, letter problems (11a) add 100

  - this is a little out of date as it uses screen scraping instead of the CSV file
